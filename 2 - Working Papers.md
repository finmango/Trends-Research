#### AI Adoption in Banking: Efficiency Gains and Employment Trade-offs (with Eren Cifi, PhD)
* The rapid advancement and integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various industries has sparked growing interest in its transformative potential. Among these sectors, the banking industry stands out as a critical area where AI applications are becoming increasingly prevalent. From customer service automation to fraud detection and risk assessment, AI technologies are being deployed to streamline operations and enhance service delivery. However, despite its expanding role, the broader implications of AI, particularly its effectiveness in improving operational outcomes and its socio-economic impact, remain underexplored in academic and policy discussions.
* This project aims to contribute to this growing body of knowledge by examining the role of AI in shaping consumer experiences and employment dynamics within the banking sector. Using a comprehensive dataset of consumer complaints reported between 2012 and 2024, we investigate whether the adoption of AI has contributed to improved banking efficiency, as reflected by a reduction in customer grievances. At the same time, we assess the potential downside of AI deployment, particularly its association with job displacement and rising unemployment in an industry historically reliant on human labor. By exploring both the benefits and potential costs of AI integration, this study provides a balanced perspective on the evolving role of AI in modern banking.

#### Tornadoes and Financial Resilience: Assessing the Effects of Natural Disasters on Community Banks (with Eren Cifi, PhD)
* Natural disasters such as tornadoes, floods, and wildfires are recurring challenges in many parts of the United States. These events can inflict severe damage on local communities, destroying homes, businesses, and infrastructure, and even resulting in loss of life. Beyond the immediate human and structural toll, such disasters also pose significant risks to the local economy. In particular, community banks, many of which are deeply tied to local real estate markets through mortgage and commercial property lending, may experience acute financial strain. The collapse of property values and rising loan defaults following a disaster can jeopardize the stability of these institutions.
* This study examines the impact of tornadoes on the financial performance and operational resilience of local banks. By analyzing changes in bank returns and efficiency measures before and after tornado events, the research seeks to understand how these shocks affect community-based financial institutions. In doing so, we also explore the factors that determine which banks manage to weather such crises and which fail to recover. Understanding these dynamics is essential for improving risk management strategies, informing policy interventions, and enhancing the long-term resilience of the banking sector in disaster-prone regions.
